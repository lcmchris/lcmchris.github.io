More and more people are becoming conscious about health and their diets. Of course there are health fads coming in and out like intermittent fasting or the carnivore diet. I think however there is a general consensus that what you consume in terms of nutrition values (not when, or what exactly) is the most important bit.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-xagb4a">This leads me on to my latest obsession. Reading nutrition labels. In particular, the ones on the front of the packaging. For those not in the UK, this is what is looks like.</p> <img src="/_app/immutable/assets/nutri_label.bde825db.jpg" width="400"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-13vbboo">It operates with a traffic light system on 4 categories, Fat | Saturates | Sugars | Salt. Being Red/Yellow/Green is based on the daily reference intake.</p> <img src="/_app/immutable/assets/label-table.2a1311c4.png" width="400"> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1nvermk">This <code>Front of Packaging</code> labelling system is not mandatory, but is quite widespread on most items. The intention is that you can at a glance quickly choose healthier items simply by picking ones with most greens.
Reality is, it’s not as simple.</p> <a href="https://www.food.gov.uk/sites/default/files/media/document/fop-guidance_0.pdf" data-svelte-h="svelte-n64l5r">Link to the full guidance</a> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-gorbsm">Deeper into the traffic light system</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1rgbvq">The table I have shown gives the illusion that the labels are <em>always based on 100g</em>. The traffic lights our but the values are not. It’s rather based on the portion size. What a portion size is, is not set in stone.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-y8q9il">The intention is to give you an idea of which foods are bad quickly. You won’t eat 100g of butter in a sitting for instance so having the values based on that, does not make sense. But if you wanted to compare it against olive oil, you can easily figure that out from the traffic lights. However, it does make it unfair to items that you use very little of but is unhealthy according to the traffic light system.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-1slh35i">Oils for example, you use very little of, but are clearly high in fat gets skewed.</p> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-12osc34">For better comparisons, I thought reading the smaller per serving values would give a better picture. But then you will be faced with the difficultly of normalising the serving size. Different cookie brands can use the same serving size (of one cooking) but have widely different cookie sizes and weights. A cookie might be actually healthier but lose out just because it is larger. I also find that some serving sizes are wildly under-represent of what people would actually consume in a sitting. One cookie per serving is just mean! Who stops at one.</p> <h2 data-svelte-h="svelte-jcfqu3">The categories</h2> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-8r1qh1">The categories listed are also in my opinion, too simplistic. Nuts which I would say are quite healthy are almost always in the red. They are high in protein, fiber, and good (fats).</p> <h1 data-svelte-h="svelte-ih0rpu">So what then?</h1> <p data-svelte-h="svelte-z5epsl">Clearly comparing foods is hard. No one metric can determine if a food is healthier than others. Balance is key in a diet so straight head to head comparisons are somewhat meaningless. Is there a tech solution somewhere here?
Maybe a Receipt scanner of groceries, eating out can help analyse your current diet, and then suggest what you are missing?</p> </article></main> <footer data-svelte-h="svelte-1t347j3"><nav class="svelte-1q164s3"> <a href="https://github.com/lcmchris"><img class="icon svelte-1q164s3" src="/github-mark.svg" alt="GitHub"></a> <a href="mailto:lcmchristopher@gmail.com"><img class="icon svelte-1q164s3" src="/email.svg" alt="Email"></a> <a href="/rss.xml">RSS</a> <a href="https://follow.it/chris-l-s-blog-about-things?leanpub">Subscribe via Email</a></nav> </footer> </div>
