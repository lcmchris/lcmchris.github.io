The pyruvic acid levels of the garlic also reduces, lowering its pugency and has a softer texture.
It’s considered a disease? but
It’s different to black garlic which is fermented.`,T,f,Q="I’ve had it happen a few times to my stash of garlic. I was initially weary about using it as it look’s off, but once I did, I really enjoyed it. It’s taste is much more mellow letting me use it more sparingly. The softer texture also makes it smearable allowing it to be easily added to a marinade or paste.",L,u,U="It’s described as a defect by some sources but I didn’t really find any fault in it.",W,h,X="What really interests me is that although Garlic is a main seasoning in a chef’s arsenal, there is relatively little research on how and why it develops.",E,d,Y=`Variables:

He then asks what is the minimum about of tests to conduct to be confident enough for.
Im it he decides making 8 teas is good, 4 with milk first and 4 with milk second. Why 8?
All possible combinations of these 8 are 70. Based on pure chance, getting it all right has one possible combination.
