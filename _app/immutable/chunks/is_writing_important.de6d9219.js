This is what I do in Enlsih. You can tell in my tone that I take a very casual speaking-like tone when writing. However, When I take pen to paper with chinese, my mind goes totally blank and I can‚Äôt even piece together a proper sentence.",z,m,N="An <strong>incorrect</strong> analogy is forgetting how to spell a word in English. In English, by pronouncing the word I can probably fudge it and make it 90% there. In Chinese, its more like trying to do a life-like painting of a person you know. It‚Äôs clear as day what this person looks like but when you start, you releasize all the deatil is not there.
