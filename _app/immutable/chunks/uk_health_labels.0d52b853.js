More and more people are becoming conscious about health and their diets. Of course there are health fads coming in and out like intermittent fasting or the carnivore diet.

You won’t eat 100g of butter in a sitting for instance so having the values based on that, does not make sense. But if you wanted to compare it against olive oil, you can easily figure that out from the traffic lights. 100g vs 100g. This does make it unfair to items that you use very little of but is unhealthy according to the traffic light system. Oils for example, you use very little of, but are clearly high in fat gets skewed against things like meat.",N,y,X="For better comparisons, I think reading the smaller per serving values would give a better picture. But then you will be faced with the difficultly of normalising the serving size. Different cookie brands can use same serving sizes of one cookie but have each cookie weigh differently.

Yuka a nutrition tracking app uses the more comprhensive Nutri-Score (from EU). It includes fibre and protein as well as positive categories.
