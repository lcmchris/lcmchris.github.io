It’s a book to celebrate the Crime Writing Festival. The location is famous for being the place where Agatha Christie disapeared to during the height of her fame.</p> <h1>My thoughts</h1> <p>The book was a quick pleasurable read, perfect to finish each story during the morning commute. Each short story was unique in its plot and reveal. I particularly enjoyed 2 stories. One about the aspiring actress murdering her father in the baths and the other about a murder of a theatre actor. Both involved a <code>detective</code> figure and an advisory figure, all trying to solve the case. Both also brought up issues in society, gender and racial respectively.</p>",1);function p(e){var t=s();o(10),r(e,t)}export{p as default,i as metadata};
