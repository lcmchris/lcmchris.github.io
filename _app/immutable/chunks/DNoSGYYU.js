It boils down to who you want to write for.
Am I writing for an audience or am I writing for my own sake.</p> <p>So far, I’ve been writing whatever that comes to mind. Including this piece, as sort of a diary or note taking. Is there a grander sense of purpose of this blog? Not really. This Advent of Writing especially has been positioned as an easy way for me to write more and to put thoughts onto paper. It could be a record, though I rarely reread past pieces but more so as a practice for better writing in the future. In this sense, my current writing is wholly and selfishly for myself. It’s not positioned for really anyone to read or to comment on. It’s like hitting the gym, not for girls but for personal health. This unserious writing certainly has been fun and is not so taxing as I do not need to consider any third reader. It’s only me and I am not too judgemental.</p> <p>Could I move on to writing for an audience? Would this change how I write? Style, quality, and substance is all important. A wider audience certainly would not forgive my spelling and grammatical mistakes. A different train of thought would be required to succeed. The topic needs to be more trendy. The narrative needs to be much more sharp and punchy. There needs to be much deeper thought into what to explore within a topic. One definite aspect to change is my lack of conclusions. Because I’ve been using writing as a way to think and try to gain clarity, I don’t usually start out with a clear answer. It could be an incredibly frustrating piece to read as the author seems clueless.</p> <p>Conclusion, I currently write for myself but I do think I want to transition to write for people. The interaction between the readers and writer can help me learn how to improve and hopefully lead to new and better pieces.</p>`,1);function m(e){var t=i();n(6),a(e,t)}export{m as default,r as metadata};
