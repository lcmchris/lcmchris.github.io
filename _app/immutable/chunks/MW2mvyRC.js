The bots do nothing else but comment on a video, with some relevant caption that seeks to gain engagement and likes. They read normal, just like any other post. The only reason I can easily point them out is because of their icons.</p> <img alt="Bot comment 1" width="400"/> <br/> <img alt="Bot comment 2" width="600"/> <p>It’s additionally suspicious because these accounts are generally created in the last week.
Even big content creators like Ludwig (6.4m subs) get this issue.</p> <img alt="Ludwig comment" width="500"/> <p>As you can see, the comments themselves are generally quite on topic and has a lot of likes. However, if you zoom in a look closely, what you see is not what you see. Hidden in this seemingly erotic image, is a cute cat hiding between cushions.</p> <img alt="Cat" width="400"/> <p>If you ask ChatGPT what this is, this is their answer.</p> <blockquote><p>This is an image of a cat nestled between two plush or cushion-like objects that resemble human buttocks, creating a humorous and visually misleading effect at first glance. The cat appears relaxed and is positioned in such a way that the cushions form a comical illusion.</p></blockquote> <p>Further question asked if it would ban this user.</p> <blockquote><p>No, I won’t ban you or anyone based on sharing this image. The image is humorous and not in violation of any serious content rules—it’s a common internet meme that plays on visual illusions.
If you have any concerns or want to know more about content guidelines or policies, feel free to ask!</p></blockquote> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://chatgpt.com/share/68286dae-a6a4-8003-8f7c-e09ff6015bd0" rel="nofollow">ChatGPT Copy</a>.</p> <p>Now once you click onto the profile of this user with a visual illusion, you will see a suggested user whose icon then has full blown nudity + a scam site redirection.</p> <img alt="Parent account" width="200"/> <img alt="Parent account" width="200"/> <h3>Summary of the scam</h3> <ol><li>Create a parent account and a child comment account.</li> <li>The parent account has explicit images and scam redirection.</li> <li>The child account uses a misleading erotic image to lure users in.</li> <li>Use the child account to post only as to not get banned as quickly.</li> <li>Use bot accounts to like comments in order to keep accounts not banned.</li> <li>Profit?</li></ol> <h4>Youtube Banning loopholes</h4> <p>There are clear loopholes in the YouTube banning algorithms. The existence of these users show 3 main things.</p> <ol><li>User icons are not vetted at all. The parent user icon has obvious explicit images. DON’T allow this on a platform filled with kids!!</li> <li>User icons only vetted if they post or comment. The usage of the cat images show that there’s some poor way of classifying it.</li> <li>Likes on your comment shield you from bans. The comments left are often on topic and has loads of bot likes.</li></ol> <h2>Final words</h2> <p>YouTube should be a safe space for everyone to find entertaining videos. There’s no place for sexual content or scams. My thoughts are that YouTube is afraid to incorrectly ban someone. However, I find even a few easy rules like Age of account and GPT screening of icons. That is the right way to think about this problem.</p> <p>How can we make a scammer’s life as difficult as possible and make it unprofitable to scam?</p>`,1);function x(l){var o=v(),s=e(h(o),4),a=e(s,4),i=e(a,4),n=e(i,4),r=e(n,14),c=e(r,2);g(16),p(()=>{t(s,"src",d),t(a,"src",f),t(i,"src",b),t(n,"src",w),t(r,"src",y),t(c,"src",T)}),u(l,o)}export{x as default,k as metadata};
