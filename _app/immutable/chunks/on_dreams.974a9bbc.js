Believe in yourself and you can do whatever you want. In Hong Kong, there is a famous movie quote “if you don’t have a dream, you are no different to salted fish”. Salted fish is a delicacy where all the moisture of the fish gets dried out by the salt and air. This emphasises the importance of dreams rooted in our culture.",_,h,M="Dreams are what we strive for, an aspirational moving target, something to achieve and to be remembered by.

The less perceived time you have the less you can forsee to achieve. It’s especially true as large discoveries take a long time to materialise.

Having ego is natural. Many set out lofty goals. Some believe they are gods. You think deserve more than you have. You think your abilities you can succeed more in the future. The greater your ego the more you want, the more you think you should have and the greater the dream.",S,c,K="Reality",I,x,L="The last is your reality.

The advances of technology has drastically boosted the size of our dreams. In the stone age, maybe the greatest asipirations was to reach the moon. Now we are aiming for the stars. More tangibly, the enviornment you grow up in has an big impact on your vision of achievability. When you see others around you achieve x, you can do a quick comparison on where you match up and form a similar sized dream.
