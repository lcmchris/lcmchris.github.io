I loved how they incorporated the theatre aspect throughout the entire show. From part 1 to the ending, it’s all related to the theatre. It really reminds me of the Seance Time episode. This show can’t be done elsewhere other than in a theatre and makes it unique. You cannot bring it onto the TV or a film, it exists purely on the theatre which makes it extra special.
The usage of the live camera feed and big screen was great and felt very natural.
