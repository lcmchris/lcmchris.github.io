Advent of Code is a popular coding challenge that occurs yearly based on the Advent calendar. As with the name, it's a question a day up till Christmas eve (although this year it is reduced to only 12 days).

For this year I want to embark on a little art and writing journey. I pronounce the start of the #AdventOfArt and #AdventOfWriting.

Each day I intend to create one piece of art and complete one piece of writing. I'm not great at either and I need to improve. It does not have to amazing or the best work. The concept is to promote creation.
